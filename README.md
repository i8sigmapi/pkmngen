this project is currently in a pre-alpha state.
currently implemented features:
- shinyness calculated through randomly determined personality value and trainer/secret ids
- ability determination based on personality value, with a secondary personality value used to check for a hidden ability
- basic functionality to customize both rate and number of rolls for both personality and hidden ability through editing variables in the code
- random ivs and game-accurate characteristic determination
- nature calculation using the same method as generations 3 and 4, substituting the secondary personality value for the main one
- favorite and least favorite flavor determination based on nature
